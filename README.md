## Stop guessing at what time and day most people visit a venue
Get foot traffic data around the world for public venues like stores, restaurants, bars, supermarkets, gyms, parks, museums, attractions, malls, etc.

## Find your desired venues by analyzing foot traffic
Let's face it, in a big city there are often too many places to choose from. Using our powerful tools you can find out which places are most busy during different days of the week: filter venues on foot traffic, venue types, neighborhoods, ratings, number reviews, and more.
Try the demo on the [besttime.app](https://besttime.app?utm_source=github&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=github) website

## Be the first to know
Be the first to know if there is something special happening, or it's actually too quiet to bother.
BestTime provides live foot traffic data for popular locations. See how busy a venue is right now and how much more or less this is compared to the past weeks.


## Make your apps more intelligent using the API
Using the software API you can get foot-traffic data for individual venues, or search for multiple venues in cities.
The powerful filter functionality makes it possible to programmatically find your desired venues based on foot-traffic intensity, geographic location, day, hour, reviews, ratings, and business types.
